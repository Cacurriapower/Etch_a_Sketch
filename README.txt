Project from the The Odin Project. When the page
is loaded a 16x16 <div> grid is created; when
the mouse is hovered over any of these <div> ele-
ments they will change to a random rgb color. On
subsequent hovering the div darkens (each RGB mem-
ber will reduce by 10%) until fully black (rbg(0, 0
, 0). The grid may be reset and made to any nxn
size though it is not recomended to go past 100.
